 - Install Wrangler `npm install -g wrangler`.
 - Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.
 To enable Wrangler to deploy your scripts to Cloudflare, you'll need to authenticate by logging in to your Cloudflare account.
 - `wrangler login`
When wrangler automatically opens your browser to display Cloudflareâ€™s consent screen, click the Allow button. This will send an API Token to Wrangler.

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰
